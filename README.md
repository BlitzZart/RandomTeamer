# RandomTeamer
A simple WPF application made to create randomized teams with the desired size. Plus, "incompatible/illegal" team member relation can be set.

## Known issues
1: The randomize process may fail if too many dependencies between the various users are set.
2: If e.g. team size was set to 2 and afterward to 3 - it is not recognized. If it was 4 and the 3 it works fine.
